### **Linear Search**

**Iterate across a data structure from left to right, searching for a specificied element.**

**In pseudocode**:

- Repeat, starting at the first element:
    - if the first element is what you're looking for (target), stop.
    - Otherwise, move to the next element

#### Complexity

| Worse-case | Best-case |
|------------|-------------------|
| O(n): look at every single element | Î©(1): find the element immediately as the first element|
